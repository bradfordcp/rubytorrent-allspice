3 June 2011 - Remo

  Based on RubyTorrent 0.3.0 gem, this gem makes RubyTorrent 0.3.0 compatible with Ruby 1.9.2.
  Changes are also made to rtpeer.rb and rtpeer-ncurses.rb to allow them to be transformed into
  Windows executables using ocra with an embedded .torrent file.
  
  Changes to files may cause incompatibilities with the original RubyTorrent!
  
  rtpeercomplete.rb: Now looks for an existing torrent file in the current directory.  This allows
  Ocra to embed a torrent file into the executable that will automatically be loaded.
  
  rtpeercursescomplete.rb: Also looks for an existing torrent file.  This uses the standard Ruby
  Curses library since ncurses was incompatible in windows.  Now Ocra can be used to create a
  Windows executable with a nice Curses shell (without the dependencies!).
  
  gem install ocra
  
  To compile an executable that runs on windows:  (Must be "compiled" on a windows machine)
  
    ocra rtpeercomplete.rb <torrent_name>.torrent
    
  or
    
    ocra rtpeercursescomplete.rb <torrent_name>.torrent
  
  Then just double click the executables to run.

Original README


Try it out
----------

RubyTorrent is primarily a library. See doc/api.txt for an example of how to
use it in your Ruby applications. There are also a few executable scripts for
you to play around with.

rtpeer.rb: downloads a BitTorrent package.

rtpeer-ncurses.rb: a nicer, ncurses version of the same. (The standard Ruby
curses library appears not to play nicely with Threads, so we can't use it.)

dump-metainfo.rb: takes a .torrent metainfo file and spits out everything about
it.

make-metainfo.rb: creates a .torrent file.

dump-peers.rb: takes a .torrent metainfo file, connects to the tracker, and
displays all the peers. (hack.)
